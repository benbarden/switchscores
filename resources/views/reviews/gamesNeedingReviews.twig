<p>
    Our <a href="{{ route('topRated.allTime') }}">Top Rated</a> list only includes games
    with 3 or more reviews. Otherwise, we can't give a good enough average. The games listed below
    are those with fewer than 3 reviews in our database.
</p>

<p>
    The games listed first are the ones that have the most reviews, and would therefore take the least
    effort to get onto our Top Rated page. If you've got a review to submit, let us know on Twitter:
    <a href="https://twitter.com/worldofswitch" target="_blank">@worldofswitch</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Where applicable, they are shown with their current ratings; these should
    be taken with some caution until we have more reviews recorded.
