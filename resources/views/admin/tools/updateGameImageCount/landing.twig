<p>
    This tool will update the Image Count field for each game.
</p>
<p>
    At this time, there are no image management screens as part of Admin, so this tool
    is unlikely to be of much use. It may come in handy when those screens are added.
</p>
<p>
    For now, if any images are manually uploaded and added to the database, this screen
    can be used to recalculate the total number of images for each game without needing
    to run the command manually.
