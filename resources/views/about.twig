            World of Switch (WOS) is a site dedicated to the Nintendo Switch.
            The main focus is on charts, stats, and reviews, and providing a database
            of Switch games released in Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
            The games database is updated daily. Reviews and rankings are updated
            daily, if new reviews are available to add. eShop chart rankings for
            Europe and the US are added every Saturday.
        </p>
