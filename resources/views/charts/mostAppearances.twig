<p>
    This page shows which games have appeared most often in the Switch eShop charts.
    Games with fewer than 3 appearances in the charts are excluded.
</p>
<p>
    An appearance means the game was in the charts when we noted the game positions for the
    weekly eShop chart pages. This is regardless of where in the charts the game was
    placed.
</p>
<p>
    Starting from early June 2018, the charts changed from being a Top 15 to a Top 30.
    Additionally, two versions of the charts were shown: All games, and Download exclusives.
    Our charts reflect the All games list.
