<p>
    This page allows you to find which games were released in every month since
    the Nintendo Switch launched back in March 2017.
</p>
<p>
    The graphs show the total number of games released each month. These totals do not include
    future titles. When a game is marked as released, the total for that month will update.
</p>
<p>
    On each page, you'll find a full list of games based on their month of release.
    This is a handy way to catch up on past releases, especially in busier months.
    The month pages will also show you upcoming titles. To indicate these, the packshots
    are slightly faded.
</p>
<p>
    You can also see the <a href="{{ route('topRated.byMonthLanding') }}">Top Rated - By month</a>
    page to see the top rated games for each month.
