    The Release Calendar allows you to find which games were released in every month since
    the Nintendo Switch launched back in March 2017. You'll find a full list of games based
    on their release date, and a list of which titles ranked at the top of that
    month. This may be helpful if you'd like to catch up on a previous month's releases,
    particularly in some of the busier months.
</p>
<p>
    All ranks and ratings are subject to change as we add more reviews to the site.
    The current calendar month is provided so you can
    see how things are progressing, but should be treated with caution as the ratings of
    very new games may be particularly volatile. Additionally, upcoming games are included
    for the current month, many of which will not yet have ratings.

    Check back often to see how the latest releases stack up!
