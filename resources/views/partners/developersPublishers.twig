        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Get in touch with reviewers</strong>.
                If you're looking for sites to review your games, we've got you covered. Reviewers who have opted in to share
                their details with games companies will be listed on the dashboard.
                (Not shown on the screenshot for privacy reasons.)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fill in the gaps with review coverage</strong>.
                If your game has already been covered by a few sites and you're not sure who to ask next,
                our unique review coverage feature will show you who has and hasn't covered your game. We suggest you
                keep track of who you've already asked :)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>A public profile page for your company</strong>.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Keep track of reviews for your Switch titles</strong>.
                If your games are reviewed by our review partners, you'll be able to access these from the
                dashboard.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>See which of your games are ranked or unranked</strong>.
                We need a minimum of 3 reviews to rank a game. If any of your games are unranked, you'll
                be able to see this here.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to join</h2>

        <p>
            There are two ways you can get access to the games company dashboard:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Go to the <a href="{{ route('login') }}">login page</a> and sign up with Twitter. Then
                <a href="{{ route('about.landing') }}">get in touch</a> and we'll complete the setup for you.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you've got an invite code, you can <a href="{{ route('register') }}">register</a> with
                your email address and a password - no need to use Twitter.
                There's an added bonus if you go this route: we can create an invite
                code that will automatically give you access to your details on the games company dashboard.
                <a href="{{ route('about.landing') }}">Get in touch</a> and we'll be happy to give you an invite code.
            </li>
        </ol>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-md-4">

        {% include 'modules/tables/slick-header-title.twig' with {'titleText': 'Working with developers'} %}
        <p>
            We have focused more on publishers as the data is more readily available.
            We'll happily work with developers too,
            but we may need a bit more help with filling in any missing details.
        </p>

        {% include 'modules/tables/slick-header-title.twig' with {'titleText': 'Need help?'} %}
        <p>
            If you run into any issues, or you'd like an invite code,
            <a href="{{ route('about.landing') }}">get in touch</a> and we'll be happy to help.
        </p>
